# cs-308-e-commerce-web

As a team of 6 we created an e-commerce website (a book store) for cs 308 course, with a functioning backend.

CS308-202102 Course Project.pdf includes the details of the expectations. Some features such as sending a mail, is missing.

We used a private repository in bitbucket (as requested by the instructor and TA) and jira, I uploaded the project to github after the end of semester.
